            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>The goal of the New Jersey Energy Portal is to provide a platform for understanding the intersection
                between energy consumption, socio-economic data, and climate factors to support better decision-making
                on energy equity, burden, and clean energy adoption.</p>

            <h3>Impact of Clean Energy</h3>
            <p>Our portal highlights the substantial benefits of clean energy programs in New Jersey. For instance, in
                2023, residents utilized over $X million in NJCEP incentives to adopt clean energy programs, leading to
                an average annual savings of X kWh per household. Furthermore, households participating in the NJ Clean
                Energy Program can reduce their annual energy costs by an average of X%.</p>
